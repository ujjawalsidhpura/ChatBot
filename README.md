#### Basic Python command line Chat Bot

Using tensorflow and tflearn, create a softmax model for machine learing to predict the responses from the hard coded JSON and respond.

Note: This is a basic working app, I will be implementing more mock data to JSON, create ability to add new data to the JSON and connect this bot with my Slack/Discord. Coming up soon.
